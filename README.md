## CLI

With the AppBuilder command-line interface, you can develop hybrid and NativeScript cross-platform mobile apps from the command line. You can learn how to add the AppBuilder commands to your command line from [http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/command-line-interface](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/command-line-interface).

### Clone the sample

1. Verify that a command prompt is running and you are logged in the Telerik Platform in the account in which you want to develop your application.

	```bash
	appbuilder sample clone sqlite
	```

The AppBuilder command-line interface shows the following message: `Successfully initialized project in the folder!`

### Run the sample

With the AppBuilder command-line interface, you can quickly test your apps on device, in the simulator or in the native emulators.

1. [Run in the device simulator.][device simulator]

# Limitations

* When you run this sample in the device simulator, AppBuilder switches to WebSQL. With WebSQL, you cannot store data larger than 5MB.
* When you run this sample in the device simulator in the Windows client, the extension for Visual Studio or the command-line interface, the simulator preserves your WebSQL entries across sessions.
